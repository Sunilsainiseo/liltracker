This means they've been engineered to withstand being submerged in water up to 3 feet deep, for up to 30 minutes. It’s important to keep in mind that these criteria are tested in 'lab conditions' where the water is still and pure. It's best to remove your Lil Tracker prior to going swimming.<\/p>"}},"25f763e4-7c78-4a42-873e-6867f967b169":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"Q: How long does the battery last?","text":"<p>A: Battery life is dependent on usage, but rest assured that even with heavy usage, our batteries will last the entire day.
