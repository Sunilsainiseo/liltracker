This means they've been engineered to withstand being submerged in water up to 3 feet deep, for up to 30 minutes. It’s important to keep in mind that these criteria are tested in 'lab conditions' where the water is still and pure. It's best to remove your Lil Tracker prior to showering.<\/p>"}},"65a3b96e-f213-4713-b1e0-984fe663405b":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"Q: How long will the battery last?","text":"<p>A: While battery life is dependent on usage, rest assured that even under heavy use conditions, a fully charged Lil Tracker battery should last the entire day. And while it’s possible that your battery could last 2-3 days, we recommend charging it nightly, just to make sure. <br\/><\/p>"}},"3934f594-0080-474b-a21b-8302408c01a1":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"Q: Where can I get a SIM card for the Lil Tracker watch?","text":"<p>A: We offer the SIM cards here: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.liltracker.com\/pages\/sim-and-data-plans\" target=\"_blank\">www.liltracker.com\/pages\/sim-and-data-plans<\/a><\/p>"}},"0fc73395-3d55-4775-8d9f-48372de1e266":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"Q: Can I use my own SIM card instead of one obtained directly from Lil Tracker?","text":"<p>A: For customers in the US, we strongly recommend our SIM cards.
